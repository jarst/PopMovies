[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jarst/PopMoviesy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jarst/PopMovies)

This application lists the most popular and best rated movies according to http://themoviedb.org.

## Setup
Before you attempt to compile and launch the application, you need to **set the API key**!

In order to do it, open `app\src\main\res\values\api.xml` and add it inside "`api_key_value`" element.
